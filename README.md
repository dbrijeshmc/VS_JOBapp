# Career Platform — Personal Career Operating System

A production-ready, modular monolith web platform designed to manage the end-to-end candidate job-search lifecycle: from comprehensive profile management, resume versioning, and document vaults to opportunity discovery, application pipeline tracking, recruiter networking, interview preparation, unified calendar/tasks, and real data-driven career analytics.

## 🏛 Architecture Overview

```
React 18 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS (Vite SPA)
                       ↓ (REST API / JSON / HttpOnly Cookies)
                 FastAPI Monolith
                       ↓ (SQLAlchemy 2.0 Async ORM)
             PostgreSQL 16 (31 Relational Tables)
                       +
        StorageService (Local / Azure Blob Storage)
```

- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, TanStack React Query, Zustand, Lucide Icons, Vite.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.12+), SQLAlchemy 2.0 (asyncio + asyncpg), Alembic, Pydantic v2.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16 with 31 normalized tables, foreign keys, cascade rules, composite indexes, and version locking.
- **Storage**: StorageService abstraction with LocalStorageProvider (dev) and AzureBlobStorageProvider (prod).

## 🧭 Navigation Hierarchy

The platform exposes 12 first-class domain hubs in the application shell:

1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard`): Career command center (profile completeness %, active pipeline summary, upcoming interviews, today's tasks, pending follow-ups).
2. **Profile** (`/profile`): 13 dedicated career identity sections (Personal, Professional, Education, Experience, Projects, Skills, Certifications, Achievements, Languages, Resumes, Documents, Preferences, Links).
3. **Opportunities** (`/opportunities`, `/opportunities/saved`, `/opportunities/:id`): Manual entry and URL import discovery, saved opportunities, conversion to active application.
4. **Applications** (`/applications`, `/applications/pipeline`, `/applications/followups`, `/applications/:id`): Kanban pipeline board, table view, follow-ups, exact resume version locking, deterministic application health score, Q&A vault answers, notes, and chronological activity timeline.
5. **Companies** (`/companies`, `/companies/:id`): Company directory, recruitment history, linked applications, and key recruiter contacts.
6. **Interviews** (`/interviews`, `/interviews/:id`, `/interviews/:id/prep`): Multi-round interview tracking (screens, technical design, onsite), agenda, meeting links, and dedicated Interview Prep Hub (company/role research, anticipated questions, talking points, checklists).
7. **Tasks** (`/tasks`): Unified actionable task system across applications, interviews, contacts, and career milestones with priority levels and due dates.
8. **Calendar** (`/calendar`): Unified calendar view aggregating interviews, deadlines, follow-ups, and recruiter calls.
9. **Network** (`/network`, `/network/:id`): Professional contacts directory (recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, referrals) with communication history.
10. **Analytics** (`/analytics`, `/analytics/trends`, `/analytics/pipeline`, `/analytics/companies`, `/analytics/outcomes`, `/analytics/time`): 6 sub-dashboards with real metrics (total applications, conversion funnel, response times, velocity, resume performance).
11. **Notifications** (`/notifications`): In-platform alerts, interview countdowns, and milestone updates.
12. **Settings** (`/settings`): Platform configuration (Account, Security, Notification channels, Privacy, Active Sessions, Data Export, Appearance, Account Deletion).
