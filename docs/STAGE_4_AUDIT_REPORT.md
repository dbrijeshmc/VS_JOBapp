# Stage 4 Audit Report — Opportunities & Job Tracking
## Career & Job Application Management Platform (Career OS)

**Date:** 2026-09-11  
**Author:** Antigravity AI Assistant  
**Stage:** Stage 4 — Opportunities & Job Tracking  
**Status:** COMPLETED & AUDITED  

---

## 1. Stage 4 Status
- **Implementation Status:** 100% Complete.
- **Scope Compliance:** Strict boundary adherence. Stage 4 covers Opportunities discovery, manual entry, safe clean URL import, searching, filtering, details inspection, status/notes tracking, and bookmarking/saved queue.
- **Stage 5 Boundary Enforcement:** "Convert to Application" is purely informational in Stage 4; no `applications` records were prematurely created or manipulated.
- **Status Semantics Compliance:** The `APPLIED` status was excluded from Opportunity tracking to prevent premature application-state semantics in Stage 4. Supported statuses: `ACTIVE`, `SAVED`, `CONSIDERING`, `ARCHIVED`, `NOT_INTERESTED`.

## 3. Files Created
1. `backend/app/schemas/opportunity.py` — Pydantic v2 validation schemas for Opportunities and SavedOpportunities.
2. `backend/app/services/opportunity_service.py` — Business logic layer enforcing tenant isolation, search, filtering, and idempotent bookmarking.
3. `backend/tests/unit/test_opportunities.py` — Unit & integration test suite covering CRUD, validations, URL security, idempotency, and multi-tenant isolation.
4. `frontend/src/types/opportunity.types.ts` — TypeScript type definitions for the Opportunity domain.
5. `frontend/src/services/opportunityService.ts` — Frontend Axios service communicating with `/api/v1/opportunities`.
6. `docs/STAGE_4_AUDIT_REPORT.md` — This comprehensive audit report.

---

## 4. Files Modified
1. `backend/app/schemas/__init__.py` — Exported opportunity schemas.
2. `backend/app/api/v1/endpoints/opportunities.py` — Replaced architectural stub with complete endpoints for list, create, get, update, delete, save, unsave, and saved list.
3. `frontend/src/features/opportunities/OpportunitiesPage.tsx` — Replaced static mock scaffold with full React Query integration, search, filter dropdowns, card grid, bookmark toggles, and Add Opportunity modal.
4. `frontend/src/features/opportunities/SavedOpportunitiesPage.tsx` — Replaced static scaffold with real saved queue view, unsave action, and direct details navigation.
5. `frontend/src/features/opportunities/OpportunityDetailsPage.tsx` — Replaced mock scaffold with full opportunity details, quick status updater, personal notes editor, edit modal, delete confirmation modal, and informational Convert to Application modal.

---

## 5. Database Changes
- **Alembic Migrations Added:** 0 (None needed).
- **Explanation:** The initial schema (`001_initial_schema.py`) and SQLAlchemy models (`backend/app/models/opportunity.py`) already defined Table 18 (`opportunities`) and Table 19 (`saved_opportunities`).
- **Schema Parity Verification:**
  - `Base.metadata` table count: 31
  - Migration table count: 31
  - Diff: 0 (perfect parity).

## 6. API Endpoints Added / Activated

| HTTP Method | Route | Description | Auth Required |
|:------------|:------|:------------|:-------------:|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/opportunities` | List & search user opportunities with status, location, employment type filters, and pagination | Yes (Bearer JWT) |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/opportunities` | Create opportunity manually or via clean URL import | Yes (Bearer JWT) |

| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/opportunities/{id}/save` | Unsave opportunity from bookmark queue (idempotent) | Yes (Bearer JWT) |

---

## 7. Frontend Routes / Pages Added / Modified

| Route | Component | Status | Description |
|:------|:----------|:-------|:------------|

| `/opportunities/:id` | `OpportunityDetailsPage` | Updated | Complete job details view, quick status updater, personal notes autosave, edit modal, delete modal, and informational Stage 5 conversion preview. |

---

## 8. Opportunity Functionality
- Authenticated user can manually create an opportunity with title, company, location, work arrangement (Remote/Hybrid/On-site), employment type, compensation range, posted date, deadline, status, description, requirements, and notes.
- System validates mandatory fields, compensation bounds (`min <= max`), date ranges (`posted <= expiry`), and allowed status enums.
- External source URLs are strictly validated to require `http://` or `https://` schemes; any unsafe schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`) are rejected.
- Opportunity owner can update any field or delete the opportunity at any time.

---

## 9. Saved Opportunity Functionality
- Users can bookmark any owned opportunity via `POST /opportunities/{id}/save`.
- Bookmarking is **idempotent**: repeated save requests return the saved record and do not generate duplicate database rows.
- Unsaving via `DELETE /opportunities/{id}/save` is also **idempotent**: removing an already unsaved item completes cleanly without error.
- The `is_saved` boolean indicator is automatically evaluated and returned on `OpportunityResponse` during individual lookups and list queries without N+1 query overhead.
- Dedicated Saved Opportunities page displays all bookmarked opportunities in reverse chronological order of save timestamp.

---

## 10. Search / Filter Functionality
- **Keyword Search:** Case-insensitive search (`ILIKE`) across job title, company name, location, and description.
- **Status Filter:** Filters by `ACTIVE`, `CONSIDERING`, `SAVED`, `ARCHIVED`, `NOT_INTERESTED`.
- **Work Mode Filter:** Filters by `REMOTE`, `HYBRID`, `ON_SITE`.
- **Employment Type Filter:** Filters by `FULL_TIME`, `PART_TIME`, `CONTRACT`, `INTERNSHIP`.
- **Saved Filter:** Optional boolean filter for saved vs unsaved opportunities.
- **Pagination:** Configurable page and page size (default 20, max 100) returning structured `PaginatedResponse` (`items`, `total`, `page`, `page_size`, `total_pages`).

---

## 11. Ownership & Security Checks
- **Mandatory Authentication:** All endpoints require `Depends(get_current_user)`. Unauthenticated requests immediately return HTTP 401.
- **Strict Tenant Isolation:** All operations enforce `user_id == current_user.id`.
- **IDOR Protection:** When User B attempts to access, update, delete, save, or unsave User A's opportunity, the system returns `404 Not Found` (never 403), preventing attackers from enumerating or discovering whether another user's opportunity exists.
- **Company Reference Isolation:** When an opportunity is created or updated with a `company_id`, the system validates that the referenced company belongs to the authenticated user; referencing another user's company raises `404 Not Found`.
- **URL Security:** External URLs are validated against dangerous URI schemes (`javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`) on both backend and frontend. External links in the UI use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.

- **Paid Cloud Services:** None.
- **Third-Party SaaS Dependencies:** None.
- All development and testing performed on local PostgreSQL / SQLite in-memory, local filesystem storage, React, Vite, and FastAPI.

---

## 22. AI / Scraping Audit
- **AI Dependencies:** 0 (No LLMs, no AI matching, no generative algorithms).

---

## 23. Deferred Functionality
- **Full Application Workflow (Stage 5):** Immutable job snapshot creation on `applications`, Kanban stage pipeline, resume version locking, and Application Health calculation are deferred to Stage 5 as specified.
- **Automated Job Matching (Stage 10):** Deterministic skill/profile matching against opportunities.

---

## 24. Known Limitations
- Opportunities are currently managed on a per-user basis. Collaborative team job queues or shared company accounts are not part of the MVP specification.
- External job links open in a new browser tab and require candidate review.
