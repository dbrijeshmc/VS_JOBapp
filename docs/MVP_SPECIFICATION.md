# MVP & Staged Rollout Specification
## Career & Job Application Management Platform

**Version:** 2.0.0  
**Date:** 2026-09-07  
**Status:** Stage 0 — Rectified Architecture

## 1. Product Vision & MVP Philosophy

The Career & Job Application Management Platform is designed as a **personal Career Operating System**. It is intentionally NOT a barebones job application tracker. 

To prevent architectural debt or premature rewrites, the **scaffold (Stage 1) establishes the full structural blueprint** across all 12 platform domains (database models, routing hierarchy, UI design system, storage abstraction, and API contracts). Feature capabilities are then systematically brought online across staged milestones.

## 2. Staged Delivery Scope

### Stage 1: Scaffold & Infrastructure Foundation (Current Stage)
- Full normalized database schema (28+ tables) in PostgreSQL 16 via async SQLAlchemy 2 & Alembic.
- Storage abstraction layer (`LocalStorageProvider` and `AzureBlobStorageProvider`).
- FastAPI modular monolith structure with API routing stubs and health checks.
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Tailwind CSS shell with the complete 12-hub navigation hierarchy and route stubs.
- Base UI design system components (Button, Input, Card, Badge, Modal, EmptyState, ProgressBar).
- Containerization setup (Docker, Docker Compose, Nginx) and GitHub Actions CI baseline.

### Core Foundation Rollout (Stages 2–5)
- **Stage 2: Authentication & Sessions**: JWT access tokens + secure HttpOnly refresh cookies, user registration, login, password reset, session management.
- **Stage 3: Candidate Profile & Document Vault**: Complete profile CRUD (personal, education, experience, projects, skills, certifications, achievements, languages, links), multi-version resume management, private document vault, job preferences, and deterministic Profile Completeness engine.
- **Stage 4: Opportunity Discovery & Conversion**: Opportunity creation, search, saved opportunities, and one-click conversion of opportunities into applications.
- **Stage 5: Applications & Health Engine**: Full recruitment pipeline (List & Kanban), immutable activity timeline, note-taking, follow-up tracking, Q&A vault integration, resume version locking, and deterministic Application Health calculation.

### Ecosystem & Network Rollout (Stages 6–9)
- **Stage 6: Companies & Professional Network**: Company directory with linked applications, contact management (recruiters, hiring managers, interviewers, referrals) linked to companies and applications.
- **Stage 7: Interviews & Preparation**: Multi-round interview tracking, interview prep checklists, company research, and post-interview debriefs.
- **Stage 8: Tasks, Calendar & Notifications**: Unified polymorphic tasks, aggregated calendar view (interviews, follow-ups, deadlines), and in-app notifications.
- **Stage 9: Dashboard & Career Analytics**: Career command center dashboard and real relational aggregations (application trends, funnel conversion, response rates, time metrics).

### Intelligence, Hardening & Production (Stages 10–16)
- **Stage 10: Explainable Matching**: Rule-based matching engine comparing profile skills/preferences with opportunities.
- **Stage 11: UI/UX Refinement**: Accessibility, responsive polish, micro-animations, keyboard navigation.
- **Stage 12–14: Testing & Security**: Integration testing, security hardening (rate limits, CSRF, CSP), vulnerability audit.
- **Stage 15–16: Cloud Deployment & Monitoring**: Azure Container Apps, Azure PostgreSQL, Azure Blob Storage, Azure Monitor.

## 4. Deterministic Engines

### 4.1 Profile Completeness Engine
Calculated dynamically based on defined weights:
- Personal information (Name, Email, Location, Headline): **10%**
- Professional summary: **10%**
- At least one education record: **10%**
- At least one experience record: **15%**
- At least three skills: **10%**
- At least one resume uploaded: **15%**
- Job preferences configured: **10%**
- At least one project recorded: **10%**
- At least one social/profile link: **5%**
- At least one language recorded: **5%**
**Total: 100%**

Returns: `{ score: 85, completed: [...], missing: [...] }`

### 4.2 Application Health Engine
Deterministic audit per application:
- **Required**: Job title present, Company present, Resume attached, Current stage set, Application date set.
- **Health Penalties**: Stale application (active with no updates or follow-ups for > 14 days).
- **Suggestions (No Penalty)**: Primary recruiter/contact linked, follow-up scheduled, notes added.

Returns: `{ score: 80, status: "GOOD", checks: [...] }`
