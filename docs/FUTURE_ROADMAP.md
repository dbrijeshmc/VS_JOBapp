## 2. Future Data Engineering & Analytics Pipeline

As application and user volume grows, the platform is architected to transition from direct relational queries to an enterprise data lakehouse pipeline without modifying the transactional schema.

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│     PostgreSQL 16       │
│  Transactional Database │
└───────────┬─────────────┘
            │

┌─────────────────────────┐

└─────────────────────────┘
```

### Engineering Guardrails
- **No Premature Big Data**: Do NOT introduce PySpark or Kafka in Stage 1. PostgreSQL 16 indexes easily handle hundreds of thousands of application records with sub-millisecond aggregations.
- **Parquet Analytical Export**: Clean schemas with typed fields allow direct zero-copy conversion to Apache Arrow / Parquet when bulk data export or analytics is required.

## 3. Future Intelligence & Matching Strategy

### 3.1 Explainable Matching (Stage 10)
- Instead of black-box AI scores, the matching engine uses transparent, deterministic scoring:
  - **Skill Alignment** (40%): Direct overlap between candidate technical skills and opportunity requirements.
  - **Role & Experience Fit** (20%): Match between candidate years of experience and role expectations.
  - **Location & Work Mode Fit** (20%): Remote/hybrid preferences vs job posting location.
  - **Compensation Alignment** (20%): Minimum salary requirements vs offered range.
- Output presents transparent breakdown: "85% Match: +Matched Python, SQL; -Missing Docker experience".

### 3.2 Machine Learning & Natural Language Processing (Post-Stage 16)
- **Resume Parsing**: Safe, local PDF extraction using standard libraries (e.g. `pdfminer.six` / `PyPDF2`) to auto-populate profile fields with human confirmation.
- **Skill Taxonomy Extraction**: Standardizing skill variations (e.g. "ReactJS", "React.js" → "React") using curated taxonomies.
- **Interview Coaching Assistant**: Context-aware interview practice questions generated from job description requirements and the candidate's actual projects.

## 4. External Integrations (Post-MVP)

- **Calendar Sync**: Dynamic `.ics` subscription feed allowing Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Outlook to display upcoming interviews and task deadlines.
- **Verified Job Feeds**: Official employer API feeds (Greenhouse, Lever, Workday) for direct application status polling without fragile web scraping.
- **Communication Log**: Email thread integration (via IMAP/OAuth) to automatically track recruiter email timestamps on application activity timelines.
